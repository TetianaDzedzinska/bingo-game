This is a Bingo game application. 
In game one player gets one bingo board grid: 5*5, numbers in between 1 to 52 (it configurable in appsettings.json file). The player needs to trigger the next step, which in each step a new number will be drawn. Player must make a horizontal, diagonal or vertical line to get a BINGO.

Tech info:
 In this solution I used Onion Architecture with Domain layer (Model & Services) at the core and center part and Presentation layer using ASP.NET Core Razor.
