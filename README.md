This is a Bingo game application. In game one player gets one bingo board (grid: 5*5, numbers in between 1 to 52). The player needs to trigger the next step, which in each step a new number will be drawn.Player must make a horizontal, diagonal OR vertical line to get a BINGO.

Tech info:
 In this solution I used Onion Architecture with Domain layer(Model & Services) at the core and center part and Presentation layer ASP.NET CORE Razor.
